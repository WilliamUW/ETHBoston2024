# MonuMints - Bringing History to Life

## 🌟 Inspiration
- 🏛️ Boston houses 324 of the 351 properties listed on the National Register in Suffolk County, including 58 National Historic Landmarks.
- 🎭 As a huge fan of "Hamilton" and American history, the loss of historical sites like the Arlington Building and The Old Howard Theatre in Boston deeply moved us.
- 💡 **Vision**: Create a system that not only helps preserve Boston's historical sites but also makes them more engaging for the current generation.

## 🚀 What it does
- 🖼️ **MonuMints NFTs**: Own a piece of history and directly support the preservation of historical sites.
- 🤖 **AI-Augmented Interaction**: Each NFT acts as an AI conduit, using its metadata to enable conversations with historical figures or sites—imagine chatting with the Bunker Hill Monument about its own history!

## 🔧 How we built it
- **Framework**: Utilized Scaffold ETH + Next.js for a robust front-end and smart contract interaction.
- **Blockchain**: Deployed smart contracts on the Polygon Cardona zkEVM testnet to leverage its security and scalability while ensuring fast, secure transactions.
- **AI Integration**: Integrated OpenAI to power dynamic, informative AI responses based on each NFT's metadata.
- **Mapping**: Incorporated Mapbox to visually render the accurate locations of historical sites on our platform.
- **Wallet Integration**: Implemented Alchemy Embedded Wallet to enable seamless access to our dApp via email authentication, expanding usability to non-traditional crypto users.
- **Deployment**: Launched the project on Vercel for global accessibility and high performance, ensuring a responsive and scalable user experience.
